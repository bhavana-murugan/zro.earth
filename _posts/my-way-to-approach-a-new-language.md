Think why you want to use a specific language. Each language has it's own purpose and usage. For example if I want to automate some process in my computer I would go for `shell`. So knowing & understanding a language's purpose would solve a lot of issues even before you start typing your code.

After you choose you language, Don't jump into using dedicated IDEs and Frameworks. Yes I mean it.

Learn from basics and type things out in a text file and run your code manually.

So where do you start from?
All programming languages pretty much has same set of concepts, only logics & syntax differs.
step wise do this
- Sequential programming.
- Object Oriented. (OOP)
- Dive deeper. 


## Sequential programming
- Know if a language is statically typed or inferred. Based on this your errors & debugging would change a bit.
- Datatypes and their limits.
- Constants & literals.
- operators. 
- keywords.
- statements.
- Strings.
- Arrays.
- Control flow. 
  - conditionals.
  - loops.
- Functions - declarations & definitions 
- Memory basics. how things are stored, retrieved and passed(pass by value / reference).
- Pointers (if c/c++)

## Object oriented Programming
- Why Object Oriented is necessary. What does it hold?
- Classes & objects.
- Access modifiers.
- Constructors / destructors. (some language might not have these)
- Static, global & local variables difference & importance of existence.
- Lambdas.

    ### Concepts & syntax
    - Abstraction.
    - Inheritance.
    - Polymorphism.
    - Overloading (for c++).

## Dive deeper
- Regex.
- basics of data structures & their existence.
- lambda expressions.
- Stack.
- List.
- Dictionaries / Map.
- Map.
- Set.
- weak map / set.
- time & space complexities.
- Memory & garbage collection in deep.
- In-built Libraries. Some are os layer libraries, input output libraries, etc..

## Other topics you might want to explore
- Aspect oriented programming.
- Other Data structures & Algorithms.
- Design patterns.
- working on open source liraries.
